                <strong>1922 </strong>- Following the advice of one of his
                professors, Richard Gans, after graduating as a surveyor in
                order to obtain some money to pay for his studies and the trip,
                he enrolled at the University of Göttingen, Germany, where he
                began his studies in physics and would be a student. of the most
                distinguished scientists of the time and the century.

                <strong>1926 </strong>- His graduation thesis, supervised by Max
                von Laue and Walter Nernst, obtained an outstanding grade "Magna
                cum laude" and on June 6 of this same year, he attended the
                ritual graduation ceremony as Philosophiae Doctoris et Artium
                Liberalium Magistri, of the Friedrich Wilhelms University of
                Berlin.

              <p>
                Upon finishing his studies in Germany, Einstein suggested that
                he apply for a Rockefeller Fellowship to the International
                Education Board to go to work in Baltimore in the laboratory of
                the great American physicist Robert Williams Wood. He came first
                in the order of merits, but the scholarship was denied, as it
                was not planned to be awarded to someone who did not come from
                the US or Europe. Such a situation provoked Einstein's anger, "I
                showed him that [the rejection note] Einstein -Gaviola would
                remember- and Einstein got angry, and right there, on the edge
                of the stairs, he wrote a letter to the Rockefeller
                representative." It was the first case to be awarded to a
                candidate from the southern hemisphere.

                <strong>1928 </strong>- After completing the work with Wood, he
                moved to Washington where the work he carried out during the
                years 1928 and 1929 was notable.

                Until mid-1929 he served at that Institution as an assistant
                physicist in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Along with
                Merle Tuve and Harry Lawrence Hafstad, at the Carnegie
                Institution, working on vacuum and high-voltage techniques. He

                <strong>1930 </strong>- He returned to Argentina to work at the
                University of Buenos Aires, where he revolutionized study
                methods and gave great impetus to experimental work. He also
                managed to teach electromagnetism, radiation thermodynamics,
                kinetic theory and quantum theory for the first time, which
                until now had not been incorporated into the curriculum. He also
                began a preaching for the scientific development of the country
                and held important positions, such as Director of the
                Astronomical Observatory of Córdoba, and professor at several
                universities, such as that of Buenos Aires, where he directed
                the Chair of Physics-Chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences.
                Exact, Physical and Natural (1930-1936). He also promoted the
                creation of the Argentine Physical Association, which he would
                chair, and the Institute of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics
                of the Astronomical Observatory of Córdoba created in 1956 to
                support the activities of the Observatory.

                <strong>1931 </strong>- He receives a letter from Max Born
                proposing to send Georg Rumer, his main collaborator, to work
                with him. Unfortunately, the proposal raised by Gaviola for the
                appointment was not accepted and Argentina lost an excellent
                opportunity for the development of Theoretical Physics in the
                country.

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>1935 </strong>- The situation of the Astronomical
                Observatory of Córdoba was in a critical situation and its
                closure was even mentioned. The main problem was the unfinished
                configuration of the telescope's large mirror, in accordance
                with a project begun in 1909 to make it the largest diameter
                reflecting telescope in the southern hemisphere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Félix Aguilar, who had been designated as one of the
                Observatory's auditors to adopt a definitive solution, consulted
                Gaviola on the subject and, in a way, this was Gaviola's start
                in astronomy. To break into this new field, he decided to go to
                work with John Strong, at the then most skilled place in
                telescope building, the California Institute of Technology and
                its associate, the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. In
                this place, Strong valued Gaviola's ability and soon appointed
                him his first assistant. Together they replaced the earlier
                silvering of the 60-inch and 100-inch mirrors at the Observatory
                with the new method introduced by Strong for aluminizing the
                surfaces. And it is from here that Gaviola begins a vertiginous
                scientific career that would lead him to receive the greatest
                tributes in this field.
              </p>
              <p>
                His innovations were notable: For the first time, he introduced
                the concept of quality in the analysis of surface coating
                material (control over aluminum deposit), through spectrometric
                evaluation of vaporized materials. He also developed a
                differential method for coating surfaces in such a way as to
                carry out a localized deposition that could be applied to any
                type of surface, whether or not it had axial symmetry.

                <strong>1940 to 1947 </strong>- Gaviola was appointed Director
                of the Cordoba Astronomical Observatory. Also during this period
                the Argentine Physical Association would be created.

                Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Córdoba and creates
                the Institute of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics. Later he
                would develop various activities, the last one as a teacher at
                the Institute of Physics of Bariloche and at the National Atomic
                Energy Commission. Both in the genesis of these Institutions and
                those of CONICET and SECYT, the action of Gaviola was also
                fundamental.
